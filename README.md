# HomeMe

My team and I made this app for the HackTX 2020 Hackathon. We were interested in solving Wayfairs challenge "Create a solution to support low income or displaced families on finding and securing housing or other vital resources! Any project in this space is eligible." 

## Technologies Used
-Flutter
-Google Maps API

## What we did

Our Idea was to use Google's Map API to get the nearest places related to housing, food banks and health care. It was our first time using the google API and we only had about 19 hours to implement our idea, but given the time restraints we got pretty far and we were able to return and display a list of nearby locations with the keyword "housing".
